   ```

2. (Optional) If you have your own sound files, place them in `public/sounds/` and generate the metadata:

The soundboard can be customized by editing the `public/config.json` file. This allows you to create a soundboard for any purpose without modifying the source code.

### Configuration Options

```

## Creating Your Own Soundboard

This PWA is designed to be easily customizable for any type of soundboard. Here's how to create your own:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Audio Files

1. Place your MP3 files in the `public/sounds/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames (they'll be converted to display names)
3. Supported format: MP3 (for best browser compatibility)

### Step 2: Generate Metadata

Run the generator to create the sounds database:

```bash
npm run generate-sounds
```

This will:

- Scan all MP3 files in `public/sounds/`
- Generate `public/api/sounds.json` with metadata
- Create proper display names from filenames

### Step 3: Customize the Branding

1. Copy the example config: `cp config.example.json public/config.json`
2. Edit `public/config.json` with your details:
   - Change the title, subtitle, and description
   - Update colors to match your brand
   - Customize all UI text

### Step 4: Replace Icons (Optional)

Replace the icons in `public/icons/` with your own:

- Use the same filenames and sizes
- Recommended: 512x512 source image, scale down for other sizes
- PNG format with transparent background

### Step 5: Deploy

The app works on any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

## How It Works

### Offline Functionality

The PWA uses a service worker to cache:

- Core app files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Soundboard data (JSON)
- Audio files (MP3s)

When you visit the PWA:

1. Core files are cached immediately
2. Soundboard data is fetched and cached
3. Audio files are cached on-demand as you use them
4. Everything works offline after initial caching

### Updates

The PWA automatically checks for updates when online:

- New sounds are detected and cached automatically
- App updates trigger a notification to refresh
- Background sync keeps the soundboard current

### Performance

- Sounds are cached on first play
- Search and filtering happen client-side for speed
- Lazy loading and efficient caching strategies
- Minimal data usage when online

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no framework dependencies)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Service Worker**: Custom implementation with Workbox strategies
- **Storage**: Cache API for files, localStorage for data
- **Icons**: Progressive Web App manifest with multiple icon sizes

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support:

- Service Workers
- Cache API
- ES6+ JavaScript
- Web App Manifest
