### For Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. (Optional) If you have your own sound files, place them in `public/sounds/` and generate the metadata:

   ```bash
   npm run generate-sounds
   ```

3. (Optional) Customize the soundboard by editing `public/config.json`:

## Creating Your Own Soundboard

This PWA is designed to be easily customizable for any type of soundboard. Here's how to create your own:

### Step 1: Update ID3 Tags (Recommended)

For the best user experience, update the ID3 tags in your MP3 files before adding them to the soundboard. The generator will read these tags to create proper metadata.

#### What are ID3 Tags?

ID3 tags are metadata embedded in MP3 files that contain information like:

- **Title**: The display name for the sound
- **Artist**: Who said/created the sound

#### Tools for Editing ID3 Tags

**Free Options:**

- **Mp3tag** (Windows/Mac) - https://www.mp3tag.de/en/
- **Kid3** (Windows/Mac/Linux) - https://kid3.kde.org/
- **MusicBrainz Picard** (Windows/Mac/Linux) - https://picard.musicbrainz.org/

**Online Tools:**

- **Audio Trimmer ID3 Editor** - https://audiotrimmer.com/online-mp3-editor/
- **MP3 Tag Editor Online** - Various free online options

#### Quick Guide with Mp3tag:

1. **Download and install Mp3tag** from https://www.mp3tag.de/en/
2. **Open Mp3tag** and select your MP3 files folder
3. **Select the files** you want to edit (Ctrl+A for all)
4. **Edit the fields** in the panel below:
   - **Title**: Enter the sound's display name (e.g., "Hello there!")
   - **Artist**: Enter who said it (e.g., "Neil Rogers", "Jennifer Rehm")
   - **Album**: Optional (could be your soundboard name)
5. **Save changes** with Ctrl+S

#### Batch Editing Tips:

- **Select multiple files** to edit the Artist field for all sounds from the same person
- **Use consistent naming** for artists to group sounds properly
- **Keep titles short and descriptive** for better mobile display
- **Remove unwanted tags** (like track numbers) that aren't needed

#### Example ID3 Setup:

```
Filename: Neil-Rogers-Hello-There.mp3
Title: Hello There!
Artist: Neil Rogers
```

If you skip this step, the generator will use filenames as titles and "Unknown" as the artist.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Audio Files

1. Place your MP3 files in the `public/sounds/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames (they'll be converted to display names)
3. Supported format: MP3 (for best browser compatibility)

### Step 3: Generate Metadata

Run the generator to create the sounds database:

```bash
npm run generate-sounds
```

This will:

- Scan all MP3 files in `public/sounds/`
- Generate `public/api/sounds.json` with metadata
- Create proper display names from filenames

### Step 4: Customize the Branding

1. Copy the example config: `cp config.example.json public/config.json`
2. Edit `public/config.json` with your details:
   - Change the title, subtitle, and description
   - Update colors to match your brand
   - Customize all UI text

### Step 5: Replace Icons (Optional)

The soundboard comes with generic retro-themed icons that match the 8-bit aesthetic. To customize:

#### Option 1: Use the Built-in Icon Generator

```bash
npm run generate-icons
```

This opens `icon-generator.html` in your browser where you can:

- Preview all icon sizes
- Download PNG files with correct names
- Customize colors by editing the HTML/Canvas code

#### Option 2: Create Your Own Icons

Replace the icons in `public/icons/` with your own:

- Use the same filenames and sizes (72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512)
- PNG format recommended for best compatibility
- Start with a 512x512 source image, scale down for other sizes
- Include `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180) for iOS

#### Option 3: Edit the Source SVG

Modify `icon-source.svg` and regenerate:

- Edit colors, shapes, or design elements
- Use the generation scripts (`generate-icons.sh` or `generate-icons.bat`)
- Requires ImageMagick or online conversion tools

### Step 6: Deploy

The app works on any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)

## How It Works

### Offline Functionality

The PWA uses a service worker to cache:

- Core app files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Soundboard data (JSON)
- Audio files (MP3s)

When you visit the PWA:

1. Core files are cached immediately
2. Soundboard data is fetched and cached
3. Audio files are cached on-demand as you use them
4. Everything works offline after initial caching

### Updates

The PWA automatically checks for updates when online:

- New sounds are detected and cached automatically
- App updates trigger a notification to refresh
- Background sync keeps the soundboard current

### Performance

- Sounds are cached on first play
- Search and filtering happen client-side for speed
- Lazy loading and efficient caching strategies
- Minimal data usage when online

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript (no framework dependencies)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Service Worker**: Custom implementation with Workbox strategies
- **Storage**: Cache API for files, localStorage for data
- **Icons**: Progressive Web App manifest with multiple icon sizes

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support:

- Service Workers
- Cache API
- ES6+ JavaScript
- Web App Manifest

## Deployment

The PWA can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Firebase Hosting
- Any CDN or web server

Make sure to:

1. Serve over HTTPS (required for PWA features)
2. Set proper cache headers for audio files
3. Enable compression for better performance
